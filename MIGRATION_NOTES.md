# Portfolio Migration to React - Notes

## Overview
This portfolio has been successfully migrated from vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript to React 18 using Create React App, as requested in the issue.

## Changes Summary

### What Changed
- **Framework**: Migrated from vanilla JS to React 18
- **Build Tool**: Now using Create React App (react-scripts 5.0.1)
- **Structure**: Component-based architecture with React hooks

### What Stayed the Same
- **Design**: 100% of the original webtoon aesthetic preserved
- **Features**: All functionality (API calls, animations, responsiveness) maintained
- **Content**: All sections and content remain identical

## File Structure

### New React Files
```
src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.js          # React entry point
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.css         # All styles (from original styles.css)
  â””â”€â”€ App.js            # Main component with all sections

public/
  â””â”€â”€ index.html        # HTML template

package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
```

### Deployed Files (for GitHub Pages)
```
index.html              # Built React app entry point
static/                 # Built JS and CSS files
asset-manifest.json     # Build manifest
```

### Backup Files
```
index.html.bak          # Original HTML file
styles.css.bak          # Original CSS file
script.js.bak           # Original JavaScript file
```

## Development Commands

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run development server
```bash
npm start
```
Opens at http://localhost:3000

### Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates optimized production build in `build/` directory

### Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run deploy
```
Builds and copies files to root for GitHub Pages deployment

## React Components

The entire portfolio is now a single React component in `src/App.js` with:
- **State Management**: Using React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **API Calls**: Fetch calls for GitHub and Codeforces APIs
- **Event Handlers**: Mouse move parallax effects
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Projects and stats rendered dynamically

## Deployment

The site is configured for GitHub Pages deployment:
1. Build output is copied to the root directory
2. `index.html` and `static/` folder are served by GitHub Pages
3. CNAME file is preserved for custom domain

## Security Notes

- Production dependencies are clean (React 18.3.1, React-DOM 18.3.1)
- Development dependencies have known issues in Create React App 5.0.1 but don't affect production
- No vulnerabilities in deployed code

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements now that the site is in React:
- Add React Router for multi-page navigation
- Implement React Context for global state
- Add more interactive components
- Integrate with TypeScript
- Add unit tests with React Testing Library
